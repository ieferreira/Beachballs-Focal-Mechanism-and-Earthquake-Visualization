# Beachballs (Focal Mechanism) and Earthquake Visualization (Colombia, Bucaramanga Nest during the year 2015)

Jupyter notebook (TrabajoSismologiaCodigo.ipynb) which uses Earthquake data from 2015 in the Bucaramanga Nest (downloaded from the _Red Sismol√≥gica Nacional de Colombia_ or RSNC) the data is in the sgcSismos.xlsx file; additonally I manually picked the Earthquakes and saved it in another file (misSismos.xlsx), this file has the Focal Mechanisms calculated with Seisan (Strike SIR, DIP and Rake RAK).
